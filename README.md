Code for the #2


This is the code for the second of the assignments that we were assinged on the 9/9-2019.

This code works by turning the LED on and off continually, and then sending a message to the serial monitor after every change. 
After one rotation, going from off to on to off again, the code also prints "Reset", to signal that the process is about to reset and repeat itself.
